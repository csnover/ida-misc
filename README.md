# IDA Miscellany

Various scripts written or modified over the years to support reverse
engineering of old executables. The scripts are not always generic and
may require some slight editing to work for you, since this is mostly a dump
of work that I hacked together in a moment, so be sure to read them and edit
appropriately.

Unless otherwise noted in the script file itself, these scripts are CC0/public
domain.
